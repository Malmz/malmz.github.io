So instead of doing homework i sat down and worked on makeing this blog look less... default. Messing around a bit with some css, figureing out how Jekyll works and just removing som default stuff. There is not muth change but i will go thru some changes.

Here is a sass mixin i found [here](https://gist.github.com/paulmelnikow/7fcfbe4f68e5df7fe326) that i use for the shadow on the header.

```css
@mixin box_shadow ($level) {

    @if $level == 1 {
        box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.24);
    } @else if $level == 2 {
        box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
    } @else if $level == 3 {
        box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
    } @else if $level == 4 {
        box-shadow: 0 14px 28px rgba(0,0,0,0.25), 0 10px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.22);
    } @else if $level == 5 {
        box-shadow: 0 19px 38px rgba(0,0,0,0.30), 0 15px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.22);
    }

}
```

I also added some of my own css. So far only basic stuff like changing the header color and adding a shadow.

```css
.site-header {
  background: #212121;
  border-top: 0px;
  border-bottom: 0px;
  @include box_shadow(1);

  .site-title {
    color: #fafafa;
  }
}

.icon {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-right: 5px;
}
```

That's about it. **Thanks for reading<3**
